        <h1>Partition Plan of Mandatory Palestine and the 1947-1948
            Conflict</h1>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Following World War II and the Holocaust, there was increased
            international support for the establishment of a Jewish state in
            Palestine. Tensions between Jewish and Arab communities escalated.
        </p>

        <h2>UN Partition Plan (1947)</h2>
        <p>
            On November 29, 1947, the United Nations General Assembly adopted
            Resolution 181, proposing to partition Palestine into separate
            Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem as an international city. The
            plan allocated approximately 55% of the territory to the Jewish
            state and 45% to the Arab state.
        </p>

        <h2>Reactions to the Partition Plan</h2>
        <p>
            The Jewish community accepted the plan, viewing it as a step toward
            statehood. In contrast, the Arab community rejected it, opposing any
            division of Palestine and asserting their rights to the land.

        <h2>Outbreak of Conflict (1947-1948)</h2>
        <p>
            Following the adoption of the UN plan, violence erupted between
            Jewish and Arab groups. Clashes intensified, leading to a civil war
            in the months leading up to the British withdrawal.

        <h2>End of the British Mandate and Declaration of Independence
            (1948)</h2>
        <p>
            The British withdrew from Palestine on May 14, 1948. On the same
            day, David Ben-Gurion declared the establishment of the State of
            Israel, leading to immediate conflict with neighboring Arab states.

        <h2>Arab-Israeli War (1948-1949)</h2>
