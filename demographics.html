        <h1>Palestinian Demographics</h1>

        <h2>Population Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The Palestinian population is estimated to be around 5 million,
            including those in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and the diaspora. The
            population growth rate is relatively high compared to global
            averages.
        </p>

        <h2>Geographical Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            Palestinians are primarily concentrated in the West Bank and Gaza
            Strip. A significant portion also lives in refugee camps across the
            Middle East, particularly in Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria.
        </p>

        <h2>Ethnic Composition</h2>
        <p>
            The population is predominantly Arab, with a shared cultural and
            linguistic heritage. There are also small communities of other
            ethnic groups, including Christians and Druze.
        </p>

        <h2>Religious Composition</h2>
        <p>
            The majority of Palestinians are Muslim, primarily Sunni. There is
            also a notable Christian minority, which has historically played an
            important role in Palestinian society.
        </p>

        <h2>Aging and Youth Population</h2>
        <p>
            The demographic profile is youthful, with a significant proportion
            of the population under the age of 30. This youthful demographic
            presents both opportunities and challenges for education and
            employment.
        </p>

        <h2>Impact of Conflict</h2>
        <p>
            Ongoing conflict and displacement have significantly affected
            demographic patterns, contributing to the Palestinian diaspora and
            altering population densities in the region.
        </p>

        <p>
            Understanding Palestinian demographics is crucial for addressing
            social, economic, and political issues within the context of the
            Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
