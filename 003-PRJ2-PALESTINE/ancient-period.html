                        <h2>Neolithic period (-8300 to -4800):</h2>
                        The first human settlements in Palestine were found in
                        the Jordan
                        Valley,
                        with evidence of early migrations of Homo erectus out of
                        Africa.
                        <h2>Chalcolithic period (-4300 to -3300):</h2>
                        The Ghassulian culture developed in Palestine, with the
                        use of
                        copper and
                        the establishment of small settlements.
                        <h2>Bronze Age (-3300 to -1200):</h2>
                        The Canaanite civilization developed in Palestine, with
                        the
                        establishment of cities
                        and trade with Egypt.
                        <h2>The Bronze Age is divided into three periods:</h2>
                        <h3>Early Bronze Age (-3300 to -2200):</h3>
                        The Canaanite cities were fortified, and trade with
                        Egypt increased.
                        <h3>Middle Bronze Age (-2200 to -1550):</h3>
                        The Canaanite civilization reached its peak, with the
                        establishment
                        of
                        city-states and trade with Egypt.
                        <h3>Late Bronze Age (-1550 to -1200):</h3>
                        The Canaanite civilization declined, with the rise of
                        the Hyksos in
                        Egypt and
                        the eventual conquest of Palestine by the Egyptians.

                        <h4>Iron Age I (-1200 to -980)</h4>
                        The first Israelites settle in mountainous areas, which
                        are less
                        exposed to invasions. This culture emerges in continuity
                        with the
                        previous Canaanite culture.
                        <h4>Iron Age II (-980 to -700)</h4>
                        Sheshonq I attacks the kingdom, while Hazael ends Omride
                        dominance.
                        Assyria invades Israel in -720.
                        <h4>Iron Age III (-732 to -586)</h4>
                        In -586, Nebuchadnezzar conquers Judah, destroys the
                        Temple, and
                        deports the population, marking the beginning of the
                        Jewish
                        diaspora.
