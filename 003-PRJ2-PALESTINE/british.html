        <h1>The British Mandate in Palestine (1917-1947)</h1>

        <h2>British Capture of Jerusalem (1917)</h2>
        <p>
            During World War I, British forces capture Jerusalem in December
            1917, marking the beginning of British administration in Palestine.
            The Balfour Declaration of 1917 expresses support for the

            Palestine.

        <p>
            The League of Nations formally grants Britain the mandate over
            Palestine in 1920. The mandate aims to implement the Balfour
            Declaration while ensuring the rights of the existing Arab
            population.

            to growing tensions between Jewish and Arab communities, resulting
            in violent clashes.

        <h2>Arab Revolt (1936-1939)</h2>
        <p>
            The Arab Revolt occurs in response to British policies and Jewish
            immigration. The revolt is met with a heavy-handed military response
            from the British, leading to significant unrest and repression.
